This document outlines API for `mat-exp-button-styles` mixin.

## Usage

```scss
@use '@ngm-dev/mat-exp' as mat-exp;

html {
  @include mat-exp.mat-exp-button-styles($options);
}
```

## Options

### skip-html-element-styles

Type: `boolean`

Default: `false`

If `true`, the mixin will not apply styles to the underlying HTML elements.

**Usage example:**

```scss
@use '@ngm-dev/mat-exp' as mat-exp;

html {
  @include mat-exp.mat-exp-button-styles(
    (
      skip-html-element-styles: true,
    )
  );
}
```

#### Effects

If you set `skip-html-element-styles` to `true`, the mixin will not apply styles to the underlying HTML elements. And below are some styles which will not work as expected:

- Icon sizes
- Shape morphing

### sizes

Type: `list` of `'xs' | 's' | 'm' | 'l' | 'xl'`

Default: `null` (all sizes emitted)

Restricts the emitted CSS to only the given sizes, dropping the rest of the size × shape × state × toggle combination matrix at compile time. Use this to cut the CSS payload when your app only uses a subset of sizes — see [Reducing the CSS payload](/docs/getting-started/installation#reducing-the-css-payload).

**Usage example:**

```scss
@use '@ngm-dev/mat-exp' as mat-exp;

html {
  @include mat-exp.mat-exp-button-styles(
    (
      sizes: ('s', 'm'),
    )
  );
}
```
